# GrubbyTech - Website Redirects and Rules

# If you're using Cloudflare Pages, this file won't be used.
# The _headers file handles headers and security.
# Cloudflare Pages automatically handles redirects via _redirects file if needed.

# For reference, if you ever move to Apache hosting:
# - This would force HTTPS
# - Handle www to non-www redirects
# - Set caching rules

# For now, Cloudflare handles all of this automatically.
