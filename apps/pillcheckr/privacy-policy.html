            <h3>Google Gemini AI (Image Analysis)</h3>
            <p>We use Google Gemini AI for advanced optical character recognition (OCR) and pill image analysis.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data Shared</strong>: Photos of pills that you upload or capture are sent to Google's Gemini AI service for text extraction and analysis</li>
                <li><strong>Purpose</strong>: To identify text, numbers, and markings on pills for accurate identification</li>
                <li><strong>Processing</strong>: Images are processed through Google's cloud servers</li>
                <li><strong>Retention</strong>: Google may temporarily cache your images as described in their privacy policy</li>
                <li><strong>Training Data</strong>: According to Google's policies, data sent to Gemini API is not used to train or improve Google's models</li>
                <li><strong>Privacy Policy</strong>: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a></li>
                <li><strong>Important</strong>: By using PillCheckr's image identification features, you consent to your pill photos being processed by Google's AI services</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Google ML Kit (Text Recognition - Fallback)</h3>
            <p>We also use Google ML Kit for on-device text recognition as a fallback option.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data Shared</strong>: Text recognition processing may occur locally on your device or through Google's services</li>
                <li><strong>Purpose</strong>: Backup OCR method if primary AI service is unavailable</li>
                <li><strong>Privacy Policy</strong>: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a></li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Note</strong>: You cannot opt out of these third-party services while using the pill identification features, as they are essential to the app's core functionality. If you do not wish to share your data with these services, please do not use the image identification features.</p>

            <h2>International Data Transfers</h2>
            <p>Your information may be transferred to and maintained on servers located outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction where data protection laws may differ. By using PillCheckr, you consent to such transfers.</p>

            <h2>Data Retention</h2>
            <p>We retain your information for as long as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your account is active</li>
                <li>Needed to provide services</li>
                <li>Required by law or for legitimate business purposes</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Pill Photos</strong>: Photos are NOT retained beyond your current app session. They are used only for immediate identification and then discarded from our systems.</p>
            <p><strong>Identification Results</strong>: Text-based identification results (pill information, descriptions) are stored in your account history and retained as long as your account is active.</p>
            <p>When you delete your account, we delete your personal information and identification history within 30 days, except where we must retain it for legal or security purposes.</p>

            <h3>Future Photo Storage Feature</h3>
            <p>We may introduce an <strong>optional</strong> photo storage feature in the future that would allow you to save pill photos to your identification history for future reference. If we implement this feature:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>It will be opt-in</strong> - You must explicitly enable photo storage</li>
                <li><strong>You will be notified</strong> before this feature is available</li>
                <li><strong>This privacy policy will be updated</strong> with detailed information about photo storage</li>
                <li><strong>You will have control</strong> to delete any stored photos at any time</li>
                <li><strong>You can disable</strong> photo storage at any time in app settings</li>
                <li><strong>Your consent will be required</strong> before any photos are permanently stored</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Currently, photo storage is NOT implemented, and all photos are deleted after your session ends.</p>
